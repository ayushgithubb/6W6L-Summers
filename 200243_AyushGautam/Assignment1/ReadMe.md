The idea of this task is to build a information portal of all the members of IITK (mainly students and staff),
 which also helps in keeping a record of their ages and other stuff for the use of IITK authoririties.
 =============================================================================================================
 We have used the OOP concept of Python.The concept used here is Inheritance.
 In inheritance, there is a Parent class which is extended by child class(es).So we can say that a child class
inherits the properties of parent class. 
So in this code, we have a parent class Member,which is inherited by two child classes Student and Professor.
After that we have created a Main class which is used to create the objects for the child class and calling
the methods of the required classes via objects !!
